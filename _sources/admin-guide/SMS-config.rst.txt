Configuration
=============

SMS braodcasting is supported as standard by DialerAI, allowing DialerAI to send out thousands or millions of SMS messages to  contacts.

The SMS gateway supports the following gateways, Clickatell (http://www.clickatell.com/) and SMSGlobal (http://www.smsglobal.com). Additionally, Khomp hardware is supported to allow the use of SIM cards in house. See http://www.khomp.com.br/ for more details.

Go to the Admin interface and identify the SMS Gateway section, and click on Gateways. Listed by default are three gateways, Clickatell, SMSGlobal and Khomp. Those that you don't want to be configured can be deleted.

Click the gateway to be configured and edit the pre-filled settings and populate the fields with the credentials supplied by your SMS provider:

**URL**::

    * http://HOSTNAME_IP/admin/sms/gateway/
    * http://HOSTNAME_IP/admin/sms/gateway/add/
