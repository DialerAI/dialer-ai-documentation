Setting up Microsoft Azure Speech-to-Text (ASR)
===============================================

For Speech-to-Text (ASR) sign up to Microsoft Azure, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/, when you set up the ASR, make sure you choose eastus, we will need the API key that they provide when you add this service.


1. First step is to connect on the Azure portal and search for `Cognitive Services`
