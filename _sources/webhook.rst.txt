.. _webhook:

=======
Webhook
=======

A webhook can easily be configured in order to push CDRs to your platform or to your API endpoint. When a new CDR is created on our system, a POST request will be sent with the CDR details.
This can be useful if you need to keep some information about the call being made or need to activate some application after a dial or an inbound call is made.

The Webhook comes with a UI on the admin, https://HOSTNAME/admin/webhook/webhookcdr/ and it has a retry mechanism, which ensure that CDRs are pushed correctly.
If there is an error, for instance your endpoint didn't accept it, the error will be displayed on the UI.

The Webhook endpoint needs to accept the POST method, all the following fields will be sent:
