.. _webhook:

=======
Webhook
=======

A webhook can be configured in order to push CDRs to your own platform or API endpoint. When a new CDR is created on our system, a POST request will be sent with the CDR details.
This is used when you either need to keep information about the call being made or to activate an application after a dial or an inbound call is made.

The Webhook comes with a UI on the admin, https://HOSTNAME/admin/webhook/webhook/ and it has a retry mechanism, which ensures that CDRs are pushed correctly.
If there is an error, for instance your endpoint didn't accept the API call, it will be displayed on the UI.

The Webhook endpoint needs to accept the POST method, all the following fields will be sent:
