DialerAI is an SMS and voice broadcasting system built to support
cloud based servers and can also work on standalone servers.
It uses `Freeswitch`_ (VoIP Server) to make calls.

Using very simple steps, DialerAI will help you create campaigns, add
phonebooks, contacts, build audio messages and create complex telephony
applications for voice broadcasting.

DialerAI provides an extensive set of APIs to easily integrate with
third-party applications. Virtually every feature on the UI can be managed
via the API's.

Overview
--------

DialerAI can be used by anyone who has a need for SMS broadcasting,
mass outbound calling, voice broadcasting or providing outbound IVR Some of the
potential uses for DialerAI are listed below.

The DialerAI may be used by either companies who wish to make calls
on their own behalf, or by SaaS (Software as a Service) companies that want to
provide bulk dialling and SMS broadcasting facilities to their own customers.

DialerAI can be configured on a single server, or for really high capacity
or high speed systems, DialerAI can be configured across multiple servers.


.. _utility:

Utility
--------
DialerAI is loaded up with a list of telephone numbers that can be dialled
sequentially at very high rates of calling depending on carrier capacity and
hardware, potentially delivering many millions of calls per day.

When the called party answers the call, DialerAI passes the call to a telephony
application that is custom designed to provide the desired behaviour.

Some examples of where DialerAI may be used follow:


* **Lead Generation**: Broadcast messages to contacts with a press one facility to transfer calls to a callcentre.

* **Telecasting**: Broadcast marketing or informational messages to customers and clients.

* **Phone Polling, Surveys and Voting**: Ring large numbers of people and present
  IVR options for either polling their opinions, interactive surveys, or taking
  their vote and record the results.

* **Debt Control**: Customers can be automatically reminded at intervals that
  they owe money, and an IVR menu presented to talk to the finance department
  or passed to a credit card capture IVR to pay over the phone.

* **Dissemination of information via phone**: DialerAI was originally
  designed to call large numbers of people and disseminate medical and health advice
  via cellphone in 3rd world countries where often, literacy levels are low. On a
  local scale, it can be used to disseminate information about forthcoming community events.

* **Mass Emergency broadcast**: Where there is a necessity to warn large numbers
  of people in a short space of time, such as weather warnings, evacuation notices
  and crime prevention.

* **Subscription Reminders and Renewals**: Where a company sells an annual
  subscription for a product or service, DialerAI can be configured to
  dial the customer, remind them that the subscription is due.
