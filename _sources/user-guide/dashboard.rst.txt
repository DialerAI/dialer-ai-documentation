There are two dashboards, one for Voice and one for SMS.

.. _voice_dashboard:

Voice Dashboard
---------------

The voice dashboard gives a quick overview of both the campaign in progress, and the statistics overall and for each indvidual campaign with a selectable duration.

The Total contacts called, Duration, ASR and ALOC are displayed at the top of the page:

Definitions:
------------

* **ASR** - Average Seizure Ratio is a measure of network quality, it is calculated as the percentage of answered calls with respect to the total call made. A low ASR indicates that either the carrier is having a problem, or your call list has a large number of unobtainable / unanswered numbers. An ASR different to the norm also may indicate problems.
* **ALOC** - Average Length of Call - This is the Bill Sec divided by the total number of **answered** calls.
* **Duration** - the length of time from making the call to hangup.
* **Bill-Sec** - The length of time from call being answered to hangup.

On the next line is some reporting for the campaign results which include:-

* **First call** - When the first call was made
* **Last Call** - Time of the last call made.
* **Dial** - number of Dialed contacts not including any retries
* **Redial** -  Number of retries or redials not including the initial dial.
* **Answer** - Number of calls answered
* **No Answer** - Where the call is not answered, includes busy, unobtainable, no Answer.
* **Completed** - Where a survey has been completed according to the completed switch on the survey node.
* **% Completed** - the above figure expressed as a percentage of the total calls made
* **Transfer** - Number of calls transfered to an agent when using the transfer node
* **% Transfer** - Transferred calls expressed as a percentage of the total calls made

In the centre of the screen are pie charts for an at-a-glance result of your survey so far.

At the bottom of the screen is a graph showing calls by hours and minutes, with the ability to zoom in.

.. _sms_dashboard:

SMS Dashboard
-------------

The SMS dashboard simply shows the number of contacts in the campaign, with the number of SMS messages sent. A pie chart gives an at-a-glance overview the status of the campaign. There are filters for campaigns and time periods.
