How to create an IVR/Survey via API
====================================

We will explain how to create a Campaign, a Survey-Template and Audio via the API.

It's similar to what we do on the webUI, which you can find at http://HOSTNAME_IP/module/survey/
Therefore, make sure you are familiar with the UI.

Firstly we will upload an audio file, then create a Survey Template, add a Section to the
Survey template which will play a message, create a campaign with the Survey Template, then start it.


There are 5 points to follow:

Let's go through each point in more detail.


1) Upload audio Via API
--------------------------

Upload a new audio file with the following API/Curl command.


CURL Usage::

    curl -u username:password -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    --request POST http://HOSTNAME_IP/rest-api/audio-files/ \
    --form 'name="audio created from API"' \
    --form 'audio_file=@"/path/duck01.wav"' \
    --form 'user_id="1"'

The result should be similar to this::

    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "audio-via-API",
        "audio_file": "/usermedia/upload/audiofiles/duck01.wav",
        "user_id": 1
    }

Note the id (6), that will be your `audio-ID` for later.


2) Create a Survey Template
---------------------------

Next, create a survey template via API, this is similar to creating the survey template
on the webUI at http://HOSTNAME_IP/module/survey/add/


CURL Usage::

    curl -u username:password --dump-header - -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST --data '{"name": "Survey created from API"}' http://HOSTNAME_IP/rest-api/survey-template/

Result::

    {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest-api/survey-template/27/",
        "name": "Survey created from API",
        "description":null,
        "created_date": "2021-06-19T20:34:47.283180+02:00",
        "updated_date": "2021-06-19T20:34:47.283199+02:00",
        "user": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest-api/users/1/"
    }

You should get a result similar to the example note the Survey-Template-ID from the
result url data. (eg. "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest-api/survey-template/27/", the ID is 27)

That `survey-template-ID` will be used when you create the section & the Campaign.


3) Create a Section into your Survey Template
---------------------------------------------

So far, you have created a Survey Template. At the moment it's empty, as you can see on the UI.

You need to add at least one section for a Survey/IVR to work.
This is similar to adding a section from the webUI.

The documentation about different type of sections is at, :ref:`survey_and_ivr_configuration`

We will keep things simple here and we will create one section `Play message` (type 1),
but it's possible to create multiple sections and navigate them with branching.

Let's create a simple `Play message` section.


To create this via the API, you will need the `audio-ID` & the `survey-template-ID` from before.

Earlier our `audio-ID` was 6 and our `survey-template-ID` was 27.


Create the Section-Template via API, as follows::

    curl -u username:password --dump-header - -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST --data '{"type": "1", "audiofile": "/rest-api/audio-files/25/", "question": "Basic Message", "survey": "/rest-api/survey-template/27/"}' http://HOSTNAME_IP/rest-api/section-template/


4) Create a campaign for the previously created Survey Template
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now it's time to create a campaign, you must also have created a phonebook and imported contacts in that phonebook.

Curl example to create a campaign with IVR/Survey::

    curl -u username:password --dump-header - -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST --data '{"name": "campaign-via-api", "description": "", "callerid": "1239876", "startingdate": "2021-06-01 14:13:33", "expirationdate": "2022-08-30 13:13:33", "frequency": "100", "max_aleg":100, "max_xfer":10, "dial_method":1, "agent_dial_rate":1, "callmaxduration": "50", "maxretry": "1", "intervalretry": "3000", "calltimeout": "45", "aleg_gateway": "/rest-api/gateway/2/", "sms_gateway": "", "object_id" : "27", "extra_data": "2000", "voicemail": "True", "amd_behavior": "1", "voicemail_audiofile": "", "dnc": "", "user": "/rest-api/users/1/", "phonebook": ["/rest-api/phonebook/1/"], "daily_start_time": "00:00:00", "daily_stop_time": "23:59:59", "callerid_group": "/rest-api/callerid_group/1/"}' http://HOSTNAME_IP/rest-api/campaigns/

Keep the id from the result, that is your `Campaign-ID`.

**Parameters**::

* The `name`, try to give a unique name to your campaign.

* The `object_id` parameter is the `survey-template-ID` that you created earlier using the API or WebUI.

* The `aleg_gateway` is the gateway to be used, most of the time it will be the same one.

* You will notice more settings in the campaign APIs, if you have questions, contact support.


5) Start the campaign via API
-----------------------------

When a campaign is created via API the Campaign status is set as `New`.

If you are ready to start your campaign, it can be done with the following Update Campaign API, as follows::

    curl -u username:password --dump-header - -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH --data '{"status": 1}' http://HOSTNAME_IP/rest-api/campaigns/175/


**Note:** `status: 1` is for Started, now the system should start making calls.

You can also stop or pause a campaign via this API.

The different campaign status values are:

* 1: START
* 2: PAUSE
* 3: ABORD
* 4: END
